This document describes the protocol used by the AHABus platform (or any other
compliant bus) to transfer telemetry data from an airborne platform (typically,
a High-Altitude Balloon payload) to a ground station over a radio link.

The protocol is designed with low-bandwidth, low-power radio links in mind, to
stay within the legal limits for airborne transmission in the UK (1): 70cm
wavelength band transmissions at a power no higher than 10Â mW.
