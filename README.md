# AHABus Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the AHABus High-Altitude Balloon
platform, its core flight software ([FCORE][1]) and the protocols it uses to
transmit telemetry over radio and gather data from payload over the main payload
bus.

The documentation for the software-level communication protocols is located in
`software/`, and the documentation for the hardware bus interface will
eventually be added to `hardware/`.
